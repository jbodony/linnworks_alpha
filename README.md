# linnworks_alpha

This is the alpha Version of Linnworks module. It is an interface between Linnworks and Drupal7 Commerce service.
Linnkworks is a stock/order management service: https://www.linnworks.com/
You can add/edit any items and orders of your Webshop with it.

It supports these API calls:

https://apps.linnworks.net/Api

and implements this "Channel Integrations" manifest:

https://apps.linnworks.net/Resources/Channel


This is the the first version of this module.
I am working on the finalization/Code clean up and I will rewrite it to Drupal8 and Commerce2.
It will be a new module in the Drupal's repository soon.
